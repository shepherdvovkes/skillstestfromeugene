## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop/feature branches, PRs to main/develop
**Jobs:**
- ✅ Security checks (npm audit)
- ✅ Code quality (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- ✅ Testing (Jest with coverage)
- ✅ Build (Production build with artifacts)
- ✅ Docker (Build and test Docker image)
- ✅ Deploy staging (develop branch → staging)
- ✅ Deploy production (main branch → production)

### 2. Pull Request Checks (`pr-checks.yml`)
**Triggers:** PRs to main/develop
**Jobs:**
- ✅ Quick validation (lint, type check, tests, build)
- ✅ Security check (high-severity audit)
- ✅ Bundle size check
- ✅ Automatic PR commenting

### 3. Dependency Updates (`dependency-update.yml`)
**Triggers:** Weekly schedule (Mondays 9 AM UTC) + manual
**Jobs:**
- ✅ Check for outdated dependencies
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Create automated issues for review

### 4. Release Management (`release.yml`)
**Triggers:** Version tag pushes (v*)
**Jobs:**
- ✅ Create GitHub releases with changelog
- ✅ Build and push Docker images
- ✅ Release notifications

## 🚀 Key Features

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Caching:** npm dependencies, Docker layers, build artifacts
- **Parallel Execution:** Independent jobs run simultaneously
- **Resource Management:** Optimized for speed and efficiency

### Security & Quality:
- **Security Scanning:** npm audit, Snyk integration
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier formatting
- **Testing:** Jest with coverage reporting
- **Bundle Analysis:** Size monitoring and validation

### Deployment Strategy:
- **Environment Separation:** Staging (develop) vs Production (main)
- **Automated Deployments:** Vercel integration
- **Docker Support:** Container builds and registry pushes
- **Rollback Ready:** Artifact storage for quick recovery

### Developer Experience:
- **Fast Feedback:** PR checks provide immediate validation
- **Automated Issues:** Dependency updates create review tasks
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed error reporting
- **Manual Triggers:** Workflow dispatch for testing

## 🔧 Required Configuration

### GitHub Secrets Needed:
```
VERCEL_TOKEN          # Vercel API token
VERCEL_ORG_ID         # Vercel organization ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID     # Vercel project ID
DOCKER_REGISTRY       # Docker registry URL (optional)
SNYK_TOKEN           # Snyk API token (optional)
```

### Setup Steps:
1. **Configure Secrets:** Add required secrets to GitHub repository
2. **Vercel Setup:** Link project and get credentials
3. **Docker Registry:** Configure if using container deployment
4. **Security Tools:** Set up Snyk for advanced scanning
